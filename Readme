This Repo contains all my electricity projects I have done in the past using linux and breadboard along with other components as needed.
Most projects involve wires, LEDs, battery, multimeter, resistors etc...
My projects might also include soldering of PCB's.
Projects

Project 1:
This is a project that involves four LEDs that can function in a pattern in varying speeds and brightness.

Project 2:
This project involves three LEDs that blink at the specified speed and time between 0 and 1 to make a pattern.

Project 3:
This project involves 3 LEDs that when turned on follow a pattern and reverses the pattern when it reaches the last LED.

Project 4:
This project involves a servo where its arm can rotate to a certain degrees specified in the code. A bulb is ussed to indicate its maximum (fully lit) and minimum (dimly lit) rotation. Rotation happens with two buttons.

Project 5:
This project involves an ultrasonic sensor, a buzzer and 3 LEDs. This setup is an imitation of a car sensor where if an object is approaching closer to it, the buzzer activates and the LEDs change color according to the distance from the sensor.

Project 6:
This project involves programming a joystick. There are 4 LEDs that indicate the position of the joystick in all 360 degrees position. Also present is a PLC for Joystick to function.
